# CorgiValidator

Simple website using the Flask micro-framework written in Python. This was a website written to learn Flask.

It was also intended as a joke for my wife, who insists on getting a corgi.

There is a Vagrantfile that is used to upload to a DigitalOcean provider. Simply replace the sample API key in the Vagrantfile with your own API key to get started.
